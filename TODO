REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY
- Get '{...}' statements from html
There is a basic implementation of this already, but for more complex DOM trees these will need to split into individual text nodes.

- Moving the JS code
Mainly moving the contents of the <script /> tag into the instance function. There are also a few other edge cases (i.e. moving/naming inline event handlers out of the html) which need to be considered.

- Adding to the JS code
Svelt's reactive updates are done by marking the when changes can happen. This means first going through the JS and finding all the root level functions / variables / declarations and adding them to the return of the instance function. Then finding all uses of assignment operators for the variables, and adding the $$invalidate or $$self.$$.update wrappers.

With this functionality available, all of the BASIC FEATURES should be straight forward to implement. There is a chance the COMPOSITION FEATURES can be done with just these as well, but it might require a full JS ast (from esbuild or similar) to implement reliably.
